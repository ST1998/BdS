		<center><b>Website to archive questions of the day of Stegon's Question of the Day (SQotD)!</b><br><br>SQotD is a daily event, where I publish a post with a question of the day, from 6 to 12 o'clock and if it's not published in time, it will be postponed. The idea was born on July 30, 2019, taking inspiration from one who was frequently asked questions of the day in the videos, catching the ball and serving, first of all, to revive Prismando (my main group), and of participants' activity continued to fall:<br><br><b>Good morning World! How are you? How are you? Wake up well? I'm fine thanks!</b><br><br>The next day, I reworked it, making it more bizarre:<br><br><b>Goodmorning everyoneeeeeee!!! How are you? How are you? Family all right? Even work and even your little eyes just wake up?</b><br><br>In August 11, SQotD was officially born. At the beginning, it was an exclusive of the Prismando groups, after the success on Telegram, it was expanded in some external groups and also on Ludomedia, through a dedicated room (from August 17th), during a discussion with one if one could expand the event outside of Telegram. Every question of the day on Ludomedia is that of the previous day on Telegram (until Oct. 1). SQotD expands even more in English, for those unfamiliar with Italian (from Oct. 8).<br><br><b>To easily find a question of the day in a Telegram group, press üîç (not here, in a group) and write #SQotD. If it is not found, it means that it is not yet available.</b><center></div></div></div></div>
