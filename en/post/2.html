<b>Post of Sep. 7, 2018</b><br><br>

Don't you know what I'm talking about? SAGE is an online event for developers of fangames (games created by fans) of the Sonic series, both finished and incomplete ones (demos), but there are also a few other videogame and non-gaming brands, such as Mario, Crash, Shantae and others. For more information, <a href="http://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_Amateur_Games_Expo"><b>click here</b></a> and for all the SAGE games you can find and download them by <a href="http://sonicfangameshq.com/SAGE/games"><b>clicking here</b></a>!<br><br>

All the games you will see in the ranking have been chosen according to my liking, so do not take my words as absolute truth and do not think it is a review of each game, otherwise the whole text would be a papyrus. All of them were randomly sorted, so I won't be able to tell which one of them is better than the other. Are excluded:<br><br>

* Mods (e.g. mods to expand Sonic Mania)<br>
* Games that don't have their own identity to differentiate themselves from others<br>
* Games so buggy as to make it difficult to continue the game<br>
* Games with below mediocrity speaking of level design, graphics, music and / or playability<br><br>
