<b>Post of Jan. 24, 2020</b><br><br>

<b>It is a short story based mainly on the dialogue between Stegon and his Mind. The idea started from my boredom, leading me to make the story quite credible and plausible, that makes some laugh and that turns out to be light and smooth in reading. Recommended for those who love to read and imagine, ha ha! After this initial premise (which has been useful to cover every dialogue from the preview, I am smart!), I can begin to tell what I promised you! Enjoy the reading! ;)</b><br><br>

<b>Stegon:</b> * he stretches out of bed, keeping his arms raised and releasing a loud yawn from his mouth, after having a good rest * Mmhh ... I don't know what to do today ... * he scratches his head and tries to think about something *<br><br>

<b>The Mind:</b> * notices what he said and responds directly * Well! If you don't know, who else should know?<br><br>

<b>Stegon:</b> * begins to get slightly nervous and looks up * I didn't ask you any questions!<br><br>

<b>The Mind:</b> * responds wisely * But you thought it!<br><br>

<b>Stegon:</b> * tilts his head * And what did you deduce from?<br><br>

<b>The Mind:</b> * starts to brag * I am your mind, I know all about you, huh huh!<br><br>

<b>Stegon:</b> * tries to screw him/her * So... do you also know what I'll do today?<br><br>

<b>The Mind:</b> Er... no.<br><br>

<b>Stegon:</b> Um... don't you think it's a contradiction?<br><br>

<b>The Mind:</b> I said I know everything about you, not in general!<br><br>

<b>Stegon:</b> But your job is to make me think, otherwise you're not doing your job well...<br><br>

<b>The Mind:</b> Dude! If you are so lazy to refuse some request that is not convenient for your account, I can safely refuse your request for my laziness where you first suffer from it.<br><br>

<b>Stegon:</b> * takes on a rather annoyed expression * ...are you challenging me?<br><br>

<b>The Mind:</b> It may be and I'm sure who of us will be the winner.<br><br>

<b>Stegon:</b> * not knowing what to say anymore, throw in the towel and snort * ...ok! Forget it! It will mean that I will spend yet another flat and monotonous day as usual.<br><br>

<b>The Mind:</b> Well, I can always fix it with a little adrenaline all over your body.<br><br>

<b>Stegon:</b> Better not, the last time you gave me adrenaline, it made me so hyperactive that it made me uncontrollable and do so much damage that it was already so much if I was locked up in an asylum and I spoke in such incomprehensible language to envy the ancient Koran.<br><br>

<b>The Mind:</b> Mh! For this time I agree with you, since I was also under that effect and the memory of it is rather clouded.<br><br>

<b>Let me know what you think! ^^</b></center>
