<h2>- Introduction -</h2>

It is the first time that I write an article about one of my childhood games. Re-Volt is an atypical Racing Game, with radio-controlled vehicles that run on tracks that are reproductions of various real-life (and not) environments, which, from the point of view of vehicles, appear gigantic, which gives an unusual appearance to the tracks (that's why I called it atypical).<br><br>

RVGL is a project carried out by the community where there is the Re-Volt game completely rewritten to guarantee the complete native support on Windows (from 7 up to 10), GNU / Linux and Android (from 2.x onwards). Being Open-Source, anyone can get their hands on the source code and expand it with new vehicles, new tracks and new features that weren't in the original game.<br><br>

In this article, it will be dedicated in the installation of Re-Volt in Android devices and the nice thing is that it can run in obsolete Android versions (except 1.x). So, if you want to play it on a bad Tablet or on a Smartphone older than your shoes, you can do it! And you can play it in portrait and landscape mode! It does not require any root permission and there is no risk of breaking the device. Let's start!<br><br>

<h2>- Required requirements -</h2>

<h2><a href="https://rvgl.re-volt.io/downloads/rvgl_20.0430a_android.apk">ðŸ‘‰ DOWNLOAD ðŸ‘ˆ</a></h2>

In order to play the Android version of Re-Volt, you need to download the APK file.<br><br>

<h2><a href="https://distribute.re-volt.io/packs/game_files.zip">ðŸ‘‰ DOWNLOAD ðŸ‘ˆ</a></h2>

A tree cannot live without the seed! In fact, game files are required for the game to work properly.<br><br>

<h2><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.zdevs.zarchiver">ðŸ‘‰ DOWNLOAD ðŸ‘ˆ</a></h2>

Since some of these files are compressed in ZIP and / or 7Z format, you will need <b>ZArchiver</b>, which allows you to decompress the compressed files.<br><br>

<h2>- Optional requirements -</h2>

<h2><a href="https://distribute.re-volt.io/packs/soundtrack.zip">ðŸ‘‰ DOWNLOAD (100 MB) ðŸ‘ˆ</a></h2>

<h2><a href="http://files.re-volt.io/soundtracks/rv_soundtrack_dc_flac.7z">ðŸ‘‰ DOWNLOAD (400 MB) ðŸ‘ˆ</a></h2>

And add colors to make the drawing better! If you don't want to play in silent mode (where only the sound effects are heard), you can include the Soundtrack. There are two types, the one with <b>medium quality sound (about 100 MB)</b> and <b>the high quality one (about 400 MB)</b>.<br><br>

<h2><a href="https://rvgl.re-volt.io/downloads/rvgl_dc_pack.7z">ðŸ‘‰ DOWNLOAD ðŸ‘ˆ</a></h2>

You can enrich it even more by adding additional content originally released in the Dreamcast version, which includes the track <b>Rooftops</b> and <b>14 vehicles</b>.<br><br>

<h2><a href="https://rvgl.re-volt.io/downloads/rvgl_controller_map.apk">ðŸ‘‰ DOWNLOAD ðŸ‘ˆ</a></h2>

If you don't want to play with the Touch Screen and you want to opt for the Wireless Controller, this app allows you to map the commands to make your Controller work correctly with Re-Volt.<br><br>

<h2><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alphainventor.filemanager">ðŸ‘‰ DOWNLOAD ðŸ‘ˆ</a></h2>

In case you already have a File Manager on Android, skip the step! Otherwise, download it! You will understand later why you will need it.<br><br>

<h2>- Setup -</h2>

<b>( 1 )</b> Create a folder called <b>Re-Volt</b> and put in that folder all the files you previously downloaded, as you can see in this image:<br><br>

<b>( 2 )</b> If you downloaded files on an Android device, skip the step, otherwise, from Android activate the USB Debug from the Developer Options, and then connect the Smartphone to the PC (if you downloaded the files from there) via the USB cable. Once this is done, from the status bar (located at the top), scroll down to open the curtain and press <b>File transfer via USB activated</b> and select <b>File transfer</b>. Once this is done, the device you have connected will appear in the File Manager on PC and press there, then enter the folder where it says <b>Internal memory</b> and finally copy / paste the folder <b>Re-Volt</b>.<br><br>

<b>( 3 )</b> From the File Manager on Android and from the <b>Re-Volt</b> folder, press <b>rvgl_20.0430a_android.apk</b> (20.0430a indicates the version of the game) and, in case you get the warning that you are about to install an app that is not from the Google Play Store, don't worry! It does not contain any malware. In order to install it, you will need to activate the possibility to install apps from unknown sources on Android.<br><br>

<b>( 4 )</b> Once the game is installed, if you want to play with a Wireless Controller, press <b>rvgl_controller_map.apk</b>. Once installed, open and if you get the warning that says <b>"Configure controller 0: Android Accelerometer"?</b> press <b>Yes</b> and, from your Controller, configure each button and lever that the app highlights you in green. Once finished, the setup will be complete and the app will close. I advise you not to uninstall that app.<br><br>

<b>( 5 )</b> If you want to play with the Soundtrack and the additional contents of the Dreamcast version, from the <b>Re-Volt</b> folder, extract <b>soundtrack.zip</b> (or <b>rv_soundtrack_dc_flac.7z</b>) and <b>rvgl_dcpack.zip</b>. Next, move everything you extracted from the <b>Re-Volt</b> folder to the <b>RVGL</b> folder (located in the internal storage). If it asks you to overwrite the files, confirm the request!<br><br>

<b>( 6 )</b> From the Android Home Screen, run RVGL (indicated with the lightning bolt icon) and if the game works completely, then you have performed the whole procedure correctly! Have fun!<br><br>

<h2>- Conclusion -</h2>

In case of problems and / or if you are interested in playing a game with me (and with others), let me know in private! See you in a future article, see ya! ^^</center>
