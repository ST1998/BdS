<b>If you are an extremist vegan, I do not recommend reading, because I would not want to find one under the house that accuses me of being a chicken killer, good vision!</b><br></br>

Today I want to tell my first experience with KFC, the famous American Fast Food known mainly for fried chicken. From 2014 he arrived in Italy, after so many of our requests to want to have it in our peninsula and I want to talk about it because I care so much, since I don't hear about it often.<br></br>

While my family and I were in the rain and not being able to find an umbrella for sale in some shop, we found ourselves in front of several Fast Foods, including KFC and what led me to go there is wanting to understand ( given my curiosity) if KFC really pays a lot, since when I often go to Burger King, the sandwiches I eat usually contain chicken.<br></br>

Since it was our first time, we were a little bit difficult to choose one of the following dishes, where most of them were with chicken in different shapes, from the thighs to the fins, but since it was my first time I wanted to take a sandwich, called Double Krunch, although I was undecided between that and Zinger, where the latter was spicy because of the chicken fillet and both sandwiches have the same price (â‚¬ 6.40). In the end I took the Double Krunch.<br></br>

The service was quite fast and all the food was served in less than a minute, including the Double Krunch, the chips (thin, like those of Mc Donald's) and finally the inverted empty plastic cup, where the latter could be filled through the drink dispenser, complete with a touch screen that allowed anyone to choose a drink to be filled in the glass and we had chosen Pepsi (and for those who want to know, there was no Coca Cola, although I prefer more Pepsi, but details) and therefore it meant that you could take as much drink as you wanted, without any additional cost, because in the end it was free, exactly like the chips and in the end the total price you paid is only for the chosen sandwich, something that made me happy.<br></br>

Another thing that pleased me and that I don't often see in many Fast Foods is the possibility of using the sachet with salt inside (you can take it safely without paying for it and we would miss it more) to season the chips, giving the possibility of choice to whoever wants or does not want the salt in the chips.<br></br>

After preparing everything, the first thing I did was take the plastic cup with Pepsi inside and taste it and what surprised me was that it tasted better than it was in Burger King, it was sweeter.<br></br>

For the fries they were good and these too do not remember the taste of Burger King fries, also because those of KFC are thinner and have a different preparation and cooking.<br></br>

And the icing on the cake is instead with the sandwich, which is precisely the strong piece, which after tasting it was quite tasty and exceptional, a chicken of a certain quality to be honest, nothing to do with the chicken I ate at Burger King, as well as the rest, between the sauce that was not even spicy a bit felt and the sandwich that managed to adhere well to everything to contain. Even the cheese was not bad and for the salad we don't speak, it doesn't differ from that of Burger King, it's the same.<br></br>

In short, I ate like a god and it seems I ate a buffalo as far as chicken contained grams, so much so that already with the sandwich I felt more than half full, but cabbage! I would really like to go there just to try another sandwich or even a chicken leg or a chicken wing.<br></br>

And nothing, that's all I wanted to tell and if before you were doubtful about going to KFC, thanks to my answer you will not be anymore (at least... I hope) and you can also enter this Fast Food and order a chicken to eat.</center>
