<b>Posted in November 7, 2019</b><br><br>

To sum up, I wanted to make my personal challenge from November 5th, to spend 24 hours not communicating orally, not writing (in general) and communicating only with gestures, expressions and images. As promised, I tell you about my experience!<br><br>

<h2>- 1st day (The beginning) -</h2>
<b>- Night (0:00 - 4:59) -</b><br><br>

After advising that I would start the challenge two minutes ago before the start of the night and start the voice recording (which I kept only for myself, privacy first of all, ha ha!), I kept mine Pocophone F1 being charged (since it was less than 10% battery) and the screen turned on (so the recording cannot be interrupted in any way) with the brightness all at minimum. After doing this and checking that nothing went wrong, I went to sleep completely.<br><br>

<b>- Morning (5:00 - 11:59) -</b><br><br>

After waking up, I started cleaning my room a bit and after I finished, I started watching some videos on YouTube and reading the messages on Telegram. After my mother came into my room, she advised me to wear the Adidas branded tracksuit to look thinner and it just so happened, complimenting me for that reason, as well as the fact that it fit me perfectly. Then I went out with my parents to travel by car both to my grandmother's house and to school to accompany my little sister. To fill the waiting times, radio on with lots of different commercial music, while I started dancing like a moron, making Papozzo a little nervous, but I didn't care, ha ha! After returning home, we went to have breakfast at the bar and there too my desire to dance like a moron and make nice gestures. After finishing breakfast, I immediately went to the shop where my father worked to keep him company, although my excessive silence was not very welcome by my father, especially when I interacted with customers, where I bowed every customer as a gentleman that came in. In fact, I had sensed that my father got more nervous when I wasn't speaking completely, along with my usual dances when there was active music in the shop, rather than just saying something, often putting me in the corner, with a lot of push, which is not I appreciated how he reacted. So I was sick and after I finished repairing a PC on my own, I decided to go home.<br><br>

<b>- Afternoon (12:00 - 17:59) -</b><br><br>

After returning home, I went to the bathroom to do my needs, not before I moved the sign from Free to Busy (my idea, ha ha!). After finishing and washing completely, I started to do some cleaning and tidying up the different rooms of the house and after finishing, I set the whole table and also to boil the water in the pasta pot. And it is precisely in this arc where I completely lost the challenge, more precisely after 1:40 pm that my parents returned and wanted to know if I had already thrown the pasta to boil in the full pot, replying orally no, managing to to sense that I had lost after the decisive response of my parents, interrupting the voice recording of my smartphone, because I had lost the challenge, however, I had promised my parents that I would not give up so easily and that I wanted to try again next day.<br><br>

<b>- Evening (18:00 - 23:59) -</b><br><br>

I'll save you, nothing interesting.<br><br>

<h2>- 2nd day (The revenge) -</h2>
<b>- Night (0:00 - 4:59) -</b><br><br>

This time, I didn't go to sleep immediately, but to spend at least 2-3 to draw many drafts (both to vent my creativity and to practice drawing) with the graphic tablet, clean the room with the broom, tidy up the clothes left scattered here and there and shave off most of the hair I had in my body, including in the pubis. In the end, when I had nothing else and desire to do, I went to sleep completely.<br><br>

<b>- Morning (5:00 - 11:59) -</b><br><br>

Since I felt tired (because I hadn't slept enough), I went back to sleep and woke up around 10:00, when my mother brought me breakfast (no croissant, patience!). After a friend of my mother arrived as a guest, a few minutes later they were already in the bathroom (cleaning their hair) while discussing things mostly related to our family. I had noticed that I had not completely shaved all the body hair and I started to shave again and after finishing completely, I placed my ear in the door of my room to understand what they were saying.<br><br>

<b>- Afternoon (12:00 - 17:59) -</b><br><br>

After setting the table for five and having lunch with my friends and my sister's friend, we spent the rest of the afternoon at work. This time, my father is not at work, since he went to visit the eyes of my paternal grandmother, but my mother, my little sister and her friend of the latter are keeping company at work, where both are they do their homework and while I'm completely hidden (since I can't interact with customers if I'm silent all the time), I put a series of songs by Steve Wonder with Spotify reproduced by the excellent and cheap Bluetooth speaker, set at low volume so as not to disconcentrate the marmots who do their homework. After a few minutes, I start to suffer a bit from the heat. Just to not get bored, I immediately ran home taking and carrying my Nintendo Switch (because I had seen a client's Nintendo Switch, ha ha!) And immediately returned to the shop, playing a bit of Asphalt 9, since I haven't played with it for more than a week.<br><br>

<b>- Evening (18:00 - 23:59) -</b><br><br>

After I finished playing with my Nintendo Switch, I wanted to introduce my Signal Private Messanger app to my mother. At first she wasn't convinced, also because she already had WhatsApp and Telegram, so I convinced her through a Wikipedia page. It was fun to be able to send her a few posts in that app and thus making her receive notifications from her device, while she was busy for something else, but also to make her learn a little to use this app, giving her clear explanations and advice, managing to to understand. After returning home, my little sister and I waited a few minutes for the return of our parents with the pizza ordered and we prepared the table for dinner immediately. After finishing dinner, I immediately went back to my room to do the usual stuff, watch videos on YouTube and read the messages on Telegram. Before the real start of the Night, I wanted to take a moment to optimize even more the source code of the official website of Good morning in Stegon, thus managing to reduce the weight of the files by a lot and after finishing, I put at rest my PC, turned off the lights, prepared my pajamas and under the covers of my bed, while writing in a hurry of how my experience of this challenge was and after I finished writing, I immediately went to sleep with my mind completely broken, promising to correct some grammatical errors and to add something that I have not yet added.<br><br>

Was it easy? Not exactly, especially if you are particularly talkative and obsessed with writing. The biggest difficulty of this challenge is to risk answering someone's answer with Yes, No, Ok and Hello, where these words are often used and in contexts where we are used to using them, so much talent that we could escape some response, involuntarily imparting a primitive part of our brain. Any advice to make this challenge? Practice and get used to remaining as silent as possible, especially in certain situations where some answers may escape us. This also applies in writing, both on a piece of paper, physical and virtual keyboard. However, it was nice to take on this challenge, although I would not repeat it, if I want to be honest, since it can be tiring to remain silent all the time.<br><br>

<b>Let me know yours! ^^</b><br><br>
