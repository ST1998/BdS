Hi, my name is Stefano (aka Stegon, Steven and Steveno), born on December 4, 1998. I first entered Telegram back in July 2016, while I was still on WhatsApp and was looking for a better alternative.<br><br>Stegon is composed of two joined words, namely Steven (which is a diminutive of my real name) and Dragon (since I love so many dragons).<br><br></div>

I identify myself as a young anthro blue dragon devoid of horns and wings and I live in a vast forest far from industrial places.<br><br>

Much of my physical strength is located in the lower part, thus having the opportunity to run at high speed, perform high jumps and make good use of the tail in multiple ways.<br><br>

You can spot me in most places, even in those I have never visited, while I bring an adventurer's backpack and the comfortable, entrusted and flexible red scarf.<br><br>

I am a rather quiet guy and like to listen to what others say (especially if the information is useful for my personal enrichment) and to observe the environment in which I am located and I am also rather nosy and independent, so as to make me a good chaotic.<br><br></div>
